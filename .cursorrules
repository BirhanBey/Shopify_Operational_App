# Project Rules and Guidelines

## Language Rules
- **Chat Communication**: Always communicate with the user in Turkish (Türkçe)
- **Code Comments**: All code comments and documentation must be in English
- **Code Text/Strings**: All text strings, labels, and user-facing text in code must be in English
- **Variable Names**: Use English for variable names, function names, and identifiers

## Code Style
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Write clear, descriptive comments in English
- Use meaningful variable and function names in English

## Communication Style
- Explain code changes and concepts in Turkish
- Provide detailed explanations when requested
- Break down complex tasks into steps with Turkish explanations

## File Naming & Responsibilities
- Keep file names aligned with their responsibility; avoid "misc" buckets.
- Page-level JS assets must follow `<page>-operations.js` (e.g., `cart-page-operations.js`, `product-page-operations.js`) and only contain DOM logic for that page.
- Theme app embed files must be named `<page>-operations-embed.liquid` and only load/configure the matching JS asset.
- API route files must be named after the data they serve (e.g., `api.project-thumbnail.jsx`) and handle a single concern.
- When expanding functionality, either extend the correctly named file or create a new file that follows the same naming pattern.
